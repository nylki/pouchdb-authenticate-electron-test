# pouchdb-authentication-electron-test

**Clone and run for a quick way to see an Electron in action.**

This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

I created this project to quickly check most of the pouchdb-authentication features.

## To Use

```bash
# Install dependencies and run the app
npm install && npm start
```
